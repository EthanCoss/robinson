description = "This crate is a direct implementation of the algorithms presented in \"MODULES IN ROBINSON SPACES\" by MIKHAEL  CARMONA,  VICTOR  CHEPOI,  GUYSLAIN  NAVES AND PASCAL  PREA. \nIt can determine if a given square matrice admit a compatible order in O(nÂ²). If it does admit at least one, this crate will provide you with a permutation corresponding to one compatible order."
